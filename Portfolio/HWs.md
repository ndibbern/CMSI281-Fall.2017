| Homework 1: Spinning Some Yarn | 9 / 12 / 17 | 9 / 29 / 17 |

By now, you're probably used to seeing **arrays** of different data types, which are simply ordered, contiguous lists.

An array of Strings, for example, is simply an array of references to Strings where each index holds a (not necessarily unique) String.

 **Arrays** hold ordered data where each item may not necessarily be unique from the others.

 **Sets**, by contrast, hold *unordered* data where each item is unique.

**Example**
 For example, a set of 4 strings might look like: `{ "hi", "I", "am", "Andrew" }`

Things to note about :

- Each String in the set is unique (i.e., no duplicates).
- Because order doesn't matter, the set above is considered equivalent to the set: `{ "Andrew", "hi", "I", "am" }`

#### Yarns

------

In this assignment, we're going to develop a new data structure called a "Yarn", which is a happy medium between arrays and sets of Strings.

 A **Yarn** is an unordered collection of Strings in which duplicates are allowed. A Yarn maps Strings to the number of occurrences of each String in the Yarn.

heh... get it? Because a ball of yarn has a bunch of strings in it? (take my word for it, it's funny)

**Example**
 For each example that follows, the first entry is a sentence that has then been converted into a Yarn, which follows.

```
  Sentence 1: "I think I like this homework"
  Yarn 1:     { "I": 2, "think": 1, "like": 1, "this": 1, "homework": 1 }
  
  Sentence 2: "YARNS YARNS YARNS"
  Yarn 2:     { "YARNS": 3 }
```

Note:

- The `size` of Yarn 2 is 3, but its `uniqueSize` is 1. In other words, it contains 3 occurrences of 1 unique String.

- Remember that order does not matter for entries of a Yarn, so Yarn 1 is equivalent to: `{ "think": 1, "I": 2, "this": 1, "homework": 1, "like": 1 }` (among many other equivalent Yarns).

- The above Yarn syntax (i.e., the `{ ... }` notation) is for illustrative purposes alone; the following section describes how to programmatically implement a Yarn.

# Specifications

 **Problem 1[90 points]**

 The following section instructs you on how to implement the Yarn class, as well as expectations for each method. Read through this section and the "Restrictions" section that follow before you begin any coding!

#### Fields

------

 Your Yarn objects must be capable of accommodating 100 unique Strings.

For HW1, we will be implementing Yarns using an array of Strand objects. Each Strand (see class definition below) holds a unique String in the Yarn, as well as the number of occurrences of that String.

```
  class Strand {
      // [!] Intentionally not private fields, since
      // the Strand class will be used internally
      String text;
      int count;
      
      Strand (String s, int c) {
          text = s;
          count = c;
      }
  }
```

Note: the user of your Yarn class will never know about Strand objects -- these are merely convenient record-keeping entities to be used in the Yarn class' private fields.

As such, your Yarn class should maintain the following fields:

- `private Strand[] items;` the array of entries containing each individual String in each Yarn, as well as the number of occurrences of each String.
- `private int size;` the number of Strings currently in your Yarn (counting duplicates separately).
- `private int uniqueSize;` the number of unique Strings currently in your Yarn (counting duplicates as 1).

 The above are the only mandatory fields for the Yarn class. You may add any additional fields that help you implement the rest of the project (though my solution adds none!).

#### Constructor

------

You will define two constructors for the Yarn class:

1. A **default constructor** that merely reserves space for an array of 100 Strand objects, and instantiates the size and uniqueSize to 0.
2. A **copy constructor** parameterized by another Yarn object `Yarn (Yarn other) {...}`, that reserves space for an array of 100 Strand objects, but then copies all Strands (i.e., a deep copy that does not simply copy references to Strands) from `other` into the Yarn being constructed.

If you have any additional fields that you have defined, you should initialize them in the above as well.

#### Methods

------

Your Yarn class will implement the following interface, with individual method descriptions to follow.

 YarnInterface.java

```
  package yarn;
  
  public interface YarnInterface {
  
      boolean isEmpty ();
      int getSize ();
      int getUniqueSize ();
      boolean insert (String toAdd);
      int remove (String toRemove);
      int count (String toCount);
      void removeAll (String toNuke);
      boolean contains (String toCheck);
      String getNth (int n);
      String getMostCommon ();
      void swap (Yarn other);
      String toString ();
      
  }
```

| Methods                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `boolean isEmpty();`Returns true if the Yarn has no Strings inside, false otherwise. |
| `int getSize();`Returns the current size of the Yarn (i.e., the number of Strings inside, counting duplicates separately). |
| `int getUniqueSize();`Returns the number of unique Strings in the Yarn (counting duplicates as 1). |
| `boolean insert (String toAdd);`Adds the String toAdd to the Yarn, and returns true if successful.If the Yarn is at capacity (already at 100 unique Strings), then does nothing and returns false. |
| `int remove (String toRemove);`Removes 1 occurrence of the String toRemove from the Yarn, and returns the number of occurrences remaining after removal.If toRemove does not exist in the Yarn, simply return 0 and do nothing. |
| `void removeAll (String toNuke);`Removes ALL occurrences of the String toNuke from the Yarn.If toNuke does not exist in the Yarn, do nothing. |
| `int count (String toCount);`Return the number of occurrences of String toCount found in the Yarn. |
| `boolean contains (String toCheck);`Returns true if the String toCheck appears at least once inside of the Yarn. |
| `String getNth (int n);`Even though Yarns are order-independent, we may at times want a way to iterate through the occurrences stored within. We'll use the getNth method for this purpose.getNth is defined for 0 <= n < size, such that iterating n as many times as there are String occurrences in the Yarn will return each occurrence, but in *any* order.Because of this "any order" constraint, you may assume that any operations that would affect the contents of a Yarn (e.g., insert or remove) may invalidate an existing iteration using getNth.In other words, the requirement of getNth to produce each String occurrence in the Yarn if iterated through from the beginning is removed whenever the Yarn's contents have been modified.In other, other words, if you modify the Yarn in any way, then getNth need not adhere to any prescribed behavior. The user is assumed to know this risk.For example if your Yarn contains: { "dup":2, "unique":1}, then getNth(i) for i = 0, 1, 2 could be: i=0: "dup", i=1: "dup", i=2: "unique" OR i=0: "unique", i=1: "dup", i=2: "dup" OR i=0: "dup", i=1: "unique", i=2: "dup" (though this last one would not likely come from our implementation).Think that constraint is too contrived? Well, certain Java collections that we'll learn about make the same warning... |
| `String getMostCommon ();`Returns the String that occurs most frequently in the Yarn. In the event of a tie, you may return *either* of the most frequent. If the Yarn is empty, return null. |
| `void swap (Yarn other);`Swaps the contents of the calling Yarn and the other specified. Restriction: you may NOT use iteration/recursion to solve this problem! Hint: use fields that have references! |
| `String toString ();`Returns a String representation of the calling Yarn (useful for debugging too!).The String returned should have the following format:Begins and ends with curly-brackets `{ }`, plus a space after the starting curly-bracket and a space before the closing one.Every Strand in the Yarn is printed as `"StrandText": count`, i.e., quotation marks surrounding the Strand's text, followed by a colon, followed by a space, and finally, the count.Every Strand that is printed which is NOT the last one printed has a comma and space separating it from the next, e.g. `"Strand1": count, "Strand2": count`Hint: recall that, to add a quote character to a String, you use the escape character (backslash), a la: `"\""` (the String containing the quote character).See intro of spec for example Strands in their toString format, as well as the attached sample tests. Note: because Yarns are order-independent, you may print out your Strands in any order that makes sense in the toString result. However, you may NOT duplicate any Strand's text in the output. |

#### Static Methods

------

In addition to the above methods, you must implement the following 3 static methods:

| Methods                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `static Yarn knit (Yarn y1, Yarn y2);`Returns a *new* Yarn object consisting of a combination of all String occurrences from y1 and y2. |
| `static Yarn tear (Yarn y1, Yarn y2);`Returns a *new* Yarn object consisting of all String occurrences from y1 that do NOT appear in y2. |
| `static boolean sameYarn (Yarn y1, Yarn y2);`Returns true if y1 and y2 contain the exact same unique Strings and String occurrences (i.e., the same Strings and the same counts of each String).Note: because order does not matter for Yarns, the Strings in y1 and y2 can be found in different orders but still be considered equivalent.Refer to the notes in the above Description section for examples of equivalent Yarns. |

 **Problem 2[10 points]**

#### Unit Tests

------

In addition to the Unit Tests that are found in the following section, add at least 1 Unit Test for each method and static method, or expand each of the ones given in the next section.

Note: you do not have to use the Eclipse JUnit test suite format for this part of the assignment. Simply submit a file called YarnTests.java with your assignment that contains your unit tests, in whatever format they may be.

Add a comment to your test suite indicating each unit test that revealed a bug in your program!

------

# Unit Tests

 You may use the following sample unit tests to verify your understanding of the specifications above. Note: these are not an exclusive list of tests that I will use to grade your assignment, so to ensure as many points as possible, you should add many tests to this list (including those required above).

[ YarnTests.java](http://forns.lmu.build/classes/fall-2017/cmsi-281/homework/hw1/YarnTests.java)

# Solution Skeleton

 The following .zip file contains a solution skeleton that you may use for your submission's starting point. It is highly recommended that you download this as a scaffold and work from there.

[ Yarn Solution Skeleton](http://forns.lmu.build/classes/fall-2017/cmsi-281/homework/hw1/Yarn.zip)

------

# Solution Restrictions

 Read the following list of submission restrictions carefully! **Violating any restriction will net you a 0 on this homework!**

- You may NOT use ANY data structure from the Java collections framework in your solution (that includes ArrayLists).
- You may NOT add any methods or fields to the Yarn class' public interface. You may, however, add any private fields or methods that you like.
- Your classes and therefore source files must be named exactly as intimated above (as is in the Solution Skeleton).

------

# Hints

The implementation of this assignment requires you to make some design decisions. However, here are some hints for how you might structure your own.

- Consider making helper methods that are private to the class -- these can reduce complex code to more readable segments that better organize your thoughts, and can be used to keep your code DRY (in the case of behavior that is repeated).
- Remember that Yarns do not care about the order of their contained strings; when removing a unique String from your Yarn, consider replacing its spot in your Strand[] items array with the last unique String, and then maintaining that only the first uniqueSize items in the array will be valid entries (to avoid null pointer exceptions).

# Homework 2 - Description

| Title                             | Date Posted | Date Due     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Homework 2: Yarn 2: The Weavening | 9 / 27 / 17 | 10 / 20 / 17 |

Remember Yarns? They're back...

If you've somehow forgotten the focus of the first and only homework you've just completed, take a moment to remind yourself here:

[ Homework 1 ](http://forns.lmu.build/classes/fall-2017/cmsi-281/homework/hw1/homework-1.html)

However, unlike in Homework 1, we'll be implementing our Homework 2 Yarns as... you guessed it... Linked Lists.

In Homework 2, you will be designing the LinkedYarn class, which has an almost identical interface compared to HW1, but the details "under the hood" will be significantly different.

In addition to modifying the data structure of your LinkedYarns, you will also be adding a LinkedYarn.Iterator class to allow for iteration through the Strings in your Linked Yarn.

The details for accomplishing this task are... well... detailed next.

------

# Specifications

 **Problem 1[90 points]**

 The following section instructs you on how to implement the LinkedYarn and LinkedYarn.Iterator classes, as well as expectations for each method. Read through this section and the "Restrictions" section that follow before you begin any coding!

 Note: if you wish to use any code in your submission from my notes or my solutions to classwork / homework, you may do so without need for attribution.

### LinkedYarn

------

We'll begin by examining the LinkedYarn changes from HW1, and continue by detailing the Iterator's requirements.

For HW2, we will be implementing LinkedYarns using a **doubly linked list**.

As a refresher, here's what a doubly linked list looks like, pictorially:

![img](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~forns/assets/images/winter-2014/cs-32/week-3/linkedLists-7.PNG)

#### LinkedYarn Fields

------

 Your LinkedYarn objects must be capable of accommodating an **arbitrary** number of unique Strings (i.e., no limit any more like there was in HW1)!

Since our list is doubly linked, each Node (see class definition below) in the list holds a unique String in the LinkedYarn, the number of occurrences of that String, and references to the next and previous Nodes in the list (Nodes replace our notion of Strands from HW1).

```
  class Node {
      Node next, prev;
      String text;
      int count;
      
      Node (String t, int c) {
          text = t;
          count = c;
      }
  }
```

Note: the user of your Yarn class will never know about Node objects -- these are merely convenient record-keeping entities to be used in the LinkedYarn class' private fields.

For basic record keeping, our Yarn class should maintain the following fields (plus another detailed later):

- `private Node head;` a reference to the first Node in the list; `null` when the list is empty.
- `private int size;` the number of Strings currently in your LinkedYarn (counting duplicates separately).
- `private int uniqueSize;` the number of unique Strings currently in your LinkedYarn (counting duplicates as 1).
- `private int modCount;` (described later in LinkedYarn.Iterator spec) tracks the number of modifications made to this LinkedYarn.

 You may add any additional fields that help you implement the rest of the project.

#### LinkedYarn Constructors

------

You will define:

- **A default constructor** for the LinkedYarn class that correctly instantiates its fields to represent an empty LinkedYarn (up to you to decide how to implement)
- **A copy constructor** for the LinkedYarn class that creates a deep copy of another given LinkedYarn such that each hold the same strings, but share no Nodes.

If you have any additional fields that you have defined, you should initialize them here.

#### LinkedYarn Methods

------

Your LinkedYarn class will implement the following interface, with individual method descriptions to follow.

 LinkedYarnInterface.java

```
  package linked_yarn;
  
  public interface LinkedYarnInterface {
  
      boolean isEmpty ();
      int getSize ();
      int getUniqueSize ();
      void insert (String toAdd);
      int remove (String toRemove);
      int count (String toCount);
      void removeAll (String toNuke);
      boolean contains (String toCheck);
      String getMostCommon ();
      void swap (LinkedYarn other);
      LinkedYarn.Iterator getIterator ();
      
  }
```

| Methods                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `boolean isEmpty();`Returns true if the LinkedYarn has no Strings inside, false otherwise. |
| `int getSize();`Returns the current size of the LinkedYarn (i.e., the number of Strings inside, counting duplicates separately). |
| `int getUniqueSize();`Returns the number of unique Strings in the LinkedYarn (counting duplicates as 1). |
| `void insert (String toAdd);`Adds the String toAdd to the LinkedYarn.Increments `modCount`. |
| `int remove (String toRemove);`Removes 1 occurrence of the String toRemove from the LinkedYarn, and returns the number of occurrences remaining after removal.If toRemove does not exist in the LinkedYarn, simply return 0 and do nothing.Increments `modCount`. |
| `void removeAll (String toNuke);`Removes ALL occurrences of the String toNuke from the LinkedYarn.If toNuke does not exist in the LinkedYarn, do nothing.Increments `modCount`. |
| `int count (String toCount);`Return the number of occurrences of String toCount found in the LinkedYarn. |
| `boolean contains (String toCheck);`Returns true if the String toCheck appears at least once inside of the LinkedYarn. |
| `String getMostCommon ();`Returns the String that occurs most frequently in the LinkedYarn. In the event of a tie, you may return *either* of the most frequent. If the LinkedYarn is empty, return null. |
| `void swap (LinkedYarn other);`Swaps the contents of the calling LinkedYarn and the other specified.Increments `modCount` for both `this` and `other`. Restriction: you may NOT use iteration/recursion to implement this method! |
| `LinkedYarn.Iterator getIterator ();`Returns a reference to a new LinkedYarn.Iterator object initialized at the head.If the LinkedYarn is empty, instead `throw new IllegalStateException();` |

#### LinkedYarn Static Methods

------

In addition to the above methods, you must implement the following 3 static methods:

| Methods                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `static LinkedYarn knit (LinkedYarn y1, LinkedYarn y2);`Returns a *new* LinkedYarn object consisting of a combination of all String occurrences from y1 and y2. |
| `static LinkedYarn tear (LinkedYarn y1, LinkedYarn y2);`Returns a *new* LinkedYarn object consisting of all String occurrences from y1 that do NOT appear in y2. |
| `static boolean sameYarn (LinkedYarn y1, LinkedYarn y2);`Returns true if y1 and y2 contain the exact same unique Strings and String occurrences (i.e., the same Strings and the same counts of each String).Note: because order does not matter for Yarns, the Strings in y1 and y2 can be found in different orders but still be considered equivalent.Refer to the notes in the above Description section for examples of equivalent Yarns. |

### LinkedYarn.Iterator

------

Now that we've reviewed changes to the LinkedYarn class from HW1, let's take a look at the Iterator that we will be implementing in HW2.

 Because our list is doubly linked, our Iterators will be capable of traveling forward and backward in the list.

 Iterators will be used to iterate through the String **occurrences** of the LinkedYarn (not just the unique Strings).

For example, if our LinkedYarn contained: {"dup": 2, "unique": 1}, then an Iterator defined on that LinkedYarn would step through both occurrences of "dup" individually before progressing to the "unique" String (see unit tests for more on this).

 We will be designing a **fast fail iterator** for our LinkedYarns, which means that our Iterators will be considered invalid (and therefore unusable) if any modifications (i.e., insertion, deletion, etc.) are done to the host LinkedYarn that were not done by the Iterator itself.

We'll track this rather cleverly:

1. Our LinkedYarns will increment a counter (`modCount`) every time they are modified.
2. New Iterators created on each LinkedYarn will have *their* modification counter (`itModCount`) set to the same value.
3. If the Iterator itself ever modifies the LinkedYarn, then both the LinkedYarn's `modCount` *and* the Iterator's `itModCount` are incremented, indicating that the two are still in sync.
4. If those values ever disagree, then it means that the LinkedYarn was modified outside of the Iterator's influence, and so that Iterator will be considered invalid.

As such, we'll design our iterators so that we will never unsafely use them to access or modify any element of the LinkedYarn.

#### Iterator Fields

------

- `private Node current;` a reference to the Node that the Iterator is currently "pointing at" in the LinkedYarn.
- `private LinkedYarn owner;` a reference to the LinkedYarn on which the Iterator was created.
- `private int itModCount;` the modification count for this Iterator. Valid iterators have the same modCount as their owner.

 You may add any additional fields that help you implement your Iterator and its methods, defined below.

#### Iterator Constructor

------

Define one parameterized constructor `Iterator (LinkedYarn y);` that instantiates the Iterator at the head of the given LinkedYarn, making sure to set its `itModCounter` to that of its owner's `modCount`.

#### Iterator Methods

------

Your Iterator will implement the following interface, with method descriptions to follow:

```
  package linked_yarn;
  
  public interface LinkedYarnIteratorInterface {
  
      boolean isValid ();
      boolean hasNext ();
      boolean hasPrev ();
      String getString ();
      void next ();
      void prev ();
      void replaceAll (String toReplaceWith);
      
  }
```

| Methods                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `public boolean isValid ();`Returns true if this Iterator's `itModCount` agrees with that of its `owner`'s `modCount`, false otherwise. |
| `public boolean hasNext ();`Returns true if there is another String in the LinkedYarn after the `current`.This could be another occurrence of the String in the Node currently pointed at, or a separate String and Node entirely.Return false if either this Iterator is invalid or the `current` String is the last in the LinkedYarn. |
| `public boolean hasPrev ();`Returns true if there is another String in the LinkedYarn before the `current`.This could be another occurrence of the String in the Node currently pointed at, or a separate String and Node entirely.Return false if either this Iterator is invalid or the `current` String is the first in the LinkedYarn. |
| `public String getString ();`Returns the String that the Iterator is currently pointing at (i.e., the text of the Node it is referring to).If the Iterator is invalid, return `null` instead. |
| `public void next ();`Advances this Iterator to the next String occurrence in the LinkedYarn.This could be another occurrence of the String in the Node currently pointed at, or a separate String and Node entirely.If there is *no* next String occurrence in the LinkedYarn, `throw new NoSuchElementException();`(Note, the above requires that you `import java.util.NoSuchElementException;`, which is done for you in the solution skeleton).If the Iterator is invalid, `throw new IllegalStateException();` instead. |
| `public void prev ();`Regresses this Iterator to the previous String occurrence in the LinkedYarn.This could be another occurrence of the String in the Node currently pointed at, or a separate String and Node entirely.If there is *no* previous String occurrence in the LinkedYarn, `throw new NoSuchElementException();`(Note, the above requires that you `import java.util.NoSuchElementException;`, which is done for you in the solution skeleton).If the Iterator is invalid, `throw new IllegalStateException();` instead. |
| `public void replaceAll (String toReplaceWith);`Replaces *all* occurrences of the String that this Iterator currently points to with that given in the parameter `toReplaceWith`.Increments this Iterator's `itModCount` *and* its `owner`'s `modCount` (since this Iterator performed the modification, and so is still in sync with the host LinkedYarn).If the Iterator is invalid, `throw new IllegalStateException();` instead. |

Let's make sure we understand how our Iterators are meant to behave (the following tests are also in the sample unit tests given; see next section):

```
  ...
  
  @Test
  public void testIteratorBasics() {
      ball.insert("a");
      ball.insert("a");
      ball.insert("a");
      ball.insert("b");
      LinkedYarn.Iterator it = ball.getIterator();

      // Test next()
      LinkedYarn dolly = ball.clone();
      while (true) {
          String gotten = it.getString();
          assertTrue(dolly.contains(gotten));
          dolly.remove(gotten);
          if (it.hasNext()) {it.next();} else {break;}
      }
      assertTrue(dolly.isEmpty());
      assertFalse(it.hasNext());
      
      // Test prev()
      dolly = ball.clone();
      while (true) {
          String gotten = it.getString();
          assertTrue(dolly.contains(gotten));
          dolly.remove(gotten);
          if (it.hasPrev()) {it.prev();} else {break;}
      }
      assertTrue(dolly.isEmpty());
      assertFalse(it.hasPrev());
      
      int countOfReplaced = ball.count(it.getString());
      it.replaceAll("replaced!");
      assertEquals(countOfReplaced, ball.count("replaced!"));
      assertTrue(it.isValid());
      
      ball.insert("c");
      assertFalse(it.isValid());
  }
  
  ...
```

 You are expected to thoroughly test your Iterator methods! Do not rely on the above as sufficient testing to verify their functionality.

 **Problem 2[10 Points]**

Write a short report (1 paragraph min., 1 page max.) comparing your HW1 Yarn implementation to your HW2 LinkedYarn. Your report should highlight:

- Which operations felt easier / harder to program or execute between the sequential vs. linked list implementation (no formal analysis required).
- A scenario where you would want to use the sequential list implementation vs. the linked list one, and another scenario vice versa.

Save your report in a comment block at the end of your LinkedYarn.java class (i.e., the last thing in that file).

# Unit Tests

 You may use the following sample unit tests to verify your understanding of the specifications above. Note: these are not an exclusive list of tests that I will use to grade your assignment, so to ensure as many points as possible, you should add many tests to this list (including those required above).

Unlike in HW1, you are not required to *submit* any test case modifications, but if you choose not to make any more entirely, then ask yourself: do you feel lucky, punk? Do ya?

# Solution Skeleton

 The following .zip file contains a solution skeleton that you may use for your submission's starting point. It is highly recommended that you download this as a scaffold and work from there.

[ LinkedYarn Solution Skeleton](http://forns.lmu.build/classes/fall-2017/cmsi-281/homework/hw2/LinkedYarn.zip)

------

# Solution Restrictions

 Read the following list of submission restrictions carefully! **Violating any restriction will net you a 0 on this homework!**

- You may NOT use ANY data structure from the Java collections framework in your solution (that includes LinkedList). For that matter, you may not use *any* data structure that you did not create yourself! When in doubt, ask.
- You may NOT add any methods or fields to the Yarn class' public interface. You may, however, add any private fields or methods that you like.
- Your classes and therefore source files must be named exactly as intimated above (as is in the Solution Skeleton).

------

# Hints

The implementation of this assignment requires you to make some design decisions. However, here are some hints for how you might structure your own.

- Consider making helper methods that are private to the class -- these can reduce complex code to more readable segments that better organize your thoughts, and can be used to keep your code DRY (in the case of behavior that is repeated).
- When in doubt: Draw. Everything. Out. Programming that requires tons of reference manipulation is best visualized with pictures! Got a bug? Make sure your code matches your pictorial representation of the operation, and when all else fails, try to use the debugger.

/**
 * In my opinion programming both the sequential list and the linked list felt
 * really similar. Sequential list was more intuitive since I am more used to
 * working with arrays than I do with references. Furthermore, eventhough we went
 * through the iterator class in class, it was not as intuitive how to do all the
 * methods such that they would work with the LinkedYarn.
 *
 * On the other hand, I feel like some operatations' logic (such as add,

 * prior experience of how a Yarn worked. When I got to implement the LinkedYarn,
 * I already had an intuition of the steps that such methods needed to follow in
 * order to work correctly, the only thing that changed was doing it in a Linked
 * List rather than an array, but the algorithm was the same. Because of this, I
 * believe the level of "difficulty" between both balanced out such that both were
 * at the same level.
 *
 * I wold rather use a linked list implementation on a scenario where I do not
 * know a priori how many items will be on the list (and know that it will be large).
 * An array list would have to extend its size many times if the size is large but
 * for a linked list there is no need. Furthermore I would use linked lists in

 * constant shifting of the values (either to the right or left). However, on a
 * LinkedList there is no need to do this (can be done easily).
 *
 * On the other hand I would use an array list in a scenario where I would like
 * to have random access in constant time (need an iterator for LL). For example,
 * I had to code a program last semester for CMSI 282 where ecah time I had to access
 * the specific items in a list of items. I used an arraylist for this given that I
 * had to do this so many times and it is easier to do if you have a array (also
 * my list of items was fixed so there was no need for expansion).

# Homework 3 - Description

| Title                  | Date Posted  | Date Due    |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Homework 3: Yarnalysis | 10 / 24 / 17 | 11 / 7 / 17 |

For your last assignment, you took a cursory look at the performances of Yarns and LinkedYarns.

In this assignment, you will now do so formally on a select set of methods from Homeworks 1 and 2.

The purpose: to become comfortable analyzing the asymptotic runtime complexity of code other than your own in real-application settings.

------

# Specifications

While performing runtime analysis, sometimes our notion of input size is not clear cut. In particular:

- We might have multiple metrics of size (e.g., in a Yarn, we have both the notion of size and uniqueSize).
- We might have multiple data structures whose sizes may be different, but on which an algorithm's runtime depends (e.g., a Yarn's tear method).

For example, consider the following method that takes 2 input arrays of ints:

```
  /*
   * Returns true iff all of a1's elements are found
   * within a2
   */
  public static boolean isSubset (int[] a1, int[] a2) {
      for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++) {
          boolean contained = false;
          for (int j = 0; j < a2.length; j++) {
              if (a1[i] == a2[j]) {
                  contained = true;
                  break;
              }
          }
          if (!contained) {return false;}
      }
      return true;
  }
```

Now, let `n = a1.length` and `m = a2.length`, then the complexity of the above is O(n*m).

Notice that it would be **incorrect** to say that `isSubset` has a complexity of O(n^2) since a1 and a2 may not have the same size.

With this in mind, we'll now explore the asymptotic complexities of some of our methods from Yarn and LinkedYarn as functions of either their size or uniqueSize, depending upon how each algorithm operates.

------

 **Problem 1[25 points]**

You will use the HW1 solution for this problem:

 Homework 1 Solution 

 For each of the following methods, provide the **worst case** Big-O asymptotic runtime complexities as a function of: `s` = the size of the Yarn (i.e., the number of individual String occurrences), OR `u` = the uniqueSize of the Yarn (i.e., the number of distinct Strings). **Show your work.**

 For each method in the following section, assume that our Yarns could accommodate an infinite number of unique Strings (or else every answer would be O(1))

1. `removeAll`
2. `getNth`

------

 **Problem 2[25 points]**

You will use the HW2 solution for this problem:

 Homework 2 Solution 

 For each of the following methods, provide the **worst case** Big-O asymptotic runtime complexities as a function of: `s` = the size of the Yarn (i.e., the number of individual String occurrences), OR `u` = the uniqueSize of the LinkedYarn (i.e., the number of distinct Strings). **Show your work.**

1. `swap`
2. `insert`

------

 **Problem 3[50 points]**

You will use the HW2 solution for this problem:

 Homework 2 Solution 

 For each of the following methods, provide the **worst case** Big-O asymptotic runtime complexities as a function of: `s1, s2` = the size of the LinkedYarn (i.e., the number of individual String occurrences in y1 and y2, respectively), OR `u1, u2` = the uniqueSize of the LinkedYarn (i.e., the number of distinct Strings in y1 and y2, respectively). **Show your work.**

1. `knit`

2.  LinkedYarn.java

   ```
     /*
      * commonThreads returns a new LinkedYarn composed of all
      * occurrences that are common between y1 and y2
      * [X] Warning: this implementation is not very good
      */
     public static LinkedYarn commonThreads (LinkedYarn y1, LinkedYarn y2) {
         LinkedYarn result = new LinkedYarn(),
                    y2Clone = new LinkedYarn(y2);
         
         for (LinkedYarn.Iterator i1 = y1.getIterator(); i1.hasNext(); i1.next()) {
             String current = i1.getString();
             if (y2Clone.contains(current)) {
                 result.insert(current);
                 y2Clone.remove(current);
             }
         }
         
         return result;
     }
   ```

3.  LinkedYarn.java

   ```
     /*
      * Alternative implementation of the above that is slightly better
      */
     public static LinkedYarn betterCommonThreads (LinkedYarn y1, LinkedYarn y2) {
         LinkedYarn result = new LinkedYarn();
         for (Node curr1 = y1.head; curr1 != null; curr1 = curr1.next) {
             String text = curr1.text;
             int count1 = curr1.count,
                 count2 = y2.count(text);
             if (count2 > 0) {
                 result.insertOccurrences(text, Math.min(count1, count2));
             }
         }
         
         return result;
     }
   ```

Note: both of the above implementations are pretty bad; we'll look at better data structures for this task later in the course.

# Hints

- Not sure where to begin? Review the examples and heuristics from our week 7 and 8 lectures.
- Worried about your answers for Problem 3? It's perfectly fine to have something that looks like O(u1 + s2); note that these are two separate size variables (u1 and s2), and so our heuristics cannot reduce the expression further.
- It's perfectly fine to simplify the cost of a particular statement with its big-O bounding. In general, you can use the properties of big-O notation to simplify your analysis, e.g.:
  - **Summation:** If f1 = O(g1(n)) and f2 = O(g2(n)) then f1 + f2 = O(g1(n) + g2(n))
  - **Product:** If f1 = O(g1(n)) and f2 = O(g2(n)) then f1 * f2 = O(g1(n) * g2(n))

## Answer

# CMSI 281: Homework 3

## Problem 1

### removeAll:

##### find:

```java
private int find (String s) {
        for (int i = 0; i < uniqueSize; i++) { //u
            if (items[i].text.equals(s)) { // C1
                return i;					// C2
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
```

$T(u,s) = u(C1+C2) \implies O(u)$ 

##### removeFromBack:

```java
    private void replaceFromBack (int index) {
        items[index] = items[uniqueSize-1]; //C1
        items[uniqueSize-1] = null; //C2
    }
```

$T(u,s) = C1 + C2 \implies O(1)$ 

##### removeOccurrances:

```java
 private int removeOccurrences (String text, int count) {
        int index = find(text); //n
        
        // Case: no such string toRemove
        if (index == -1) {     //C1
            return 0;
        }
        
        Strand found = items[index];       // C2
        int newCount = found.count - count;//C3
        
        // Case: last instance to remove
        if (newCount <= 0) {// everything in here is constant lets just say C4 (all together)
            replaceFromBack(index); // it is constant (analysed before)
            size -= found.count;
            uniqueSize--;
            return 0;
        
        // Case: more than 1 Strand left
        } else {           // everything in here is also constatnso either way is constant worst case ( we will just keep the C4 above)
            found.count = newCount;
            size -= count;
            return newCount;
        }
    }
```

$T(u,s)= u+C1+C2+C3+C4 \implies O(u)$ 

##### Then removeAll is...

```java
public void removeAll (String toNuke) {
        int index = find(toNuke); // u
        if (index != -1) { //C1
            removeOccurrences(toNuke, items[index].count); //u
        }
    }
```

###### ANSWER

$T(u,s) = u + C1n \implies O(u)$ 

### getNth:

```java
public String getNth (int n) {
        if (n >= size || n < 0) {                    //C1
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();    //C2
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < uniqueSize; i++) {    //u
            Strand currentStrand = items[i];     //C3
            if (n < currentStrand.count) {      //C4 
                return currentStrand.text;     //in worst case should never get here
            } else {
                n -= currentStrand.count;      //C5
            }
        }
        
        // Should never get here...
        return null;                        //C6
    }
```

###### ANSWER

$T(u,s) = C1+C2+u(C3+C4 + C5)+ C6 \implies O(u)$ 

## Problem 2

### insert:

##### prependNode

```java
    private void prependNode (Node n) {
        Node oldHead = head;      //C1
        head = n;                //C2
        if (oldHead != null) {   //C3
            head.next = oldHead;  //C4
            oldHead.prev = head;   //C5
        }
    }
```

$T(u,s) = C1+C2+C3+C4+C5 \implies O(1)$ 

##### find

```java
private Node find (String toFind) {
        for (Node curr = head; curr != null; curr = curr.next) { //u
            if (curr.text.equals(toFind)) {  //C2
                return curr;				//worst case never gets gere
            }
        }
        return null;                      //C3
    }
```

$T(u,s) = uC2 + C3 \implies O(u)$ 

##### insertOccurrences:

```java
    private boolean insertOccurrences (String text, int count) {
        Node found = find(text);   //u
        
        // Case: new string, so add new Node
        if (found == null) {//C1(both cases in if and else are constant so either case worst case constant) lets just consider it goes in the if statement
            prependNode(new Node(text, count));           //C2
            uniqueSize++;                                 //C3
            
        // Case: existing string, so update count
        } else {
            found.count += count;                     
        }
        size += count;                             		//C4
        modCount++;										//C5
        
        return true;									//C6
    }
```

$T(u,s) = u+ C1+C2+C3+C4+C5+C6 \implies O(u)$ 

```java
public void insert (String toAdd) {
        insertOccurrences(toAdd, 1); //u
    }
```

###### ANSWER

$T(u,s)= u \implies O(u)$

### swap:

```java
public void swap (LinkedYarn other) {
        Node tempHead = head;            //C1
        int tempSize = size,            //C2
            tempUniqueSize = uniqueSize; //C3

        head = other.head;               //C4
        size = other.size;				//C5
        uniqueSize = other.uniqueSize;  //C6

        other.head = tempHead;          //C7
        other.size = tempSize;         //C8
        other.uniqueSize = tempUniqueSize;   //C9
        modCount++;                       //C10
        other.modCount++;                //C11
    }
```

$T(u,s)=C1+C2+C3+C4+C5+C6+C7+C8+C9+C10+C11$

###### ANSWER

$ \implies O(1)$ 

## Problem 3

### knit:

##### Constructor:

```java
    LinkedYarn (LinkedYarn other) {
        for (Node n = other.head; n != null; n = n.next) { //u1
            prependNode(new Node(n.text, n.count)); //C1 (constant from above's analysis)
            size += n.count; //C2
            uniqueSize++; //C3
        }
    }
```

$T(u1,u2,s1,s2) =u1(C1 + C2+C3) \implies O(u1)$ 

```java
    public static LinkedYarn knit (LinkedYarn y1, LinkedYarn y2) {
        LinkedYarn result = new LinkedYarn(y1); //u1
        for (Node n = y2.head; n != null; n = n.next) { //u2
            result.insertOccurrences(n.text, n.count);  //u1
        }
        return result; //C1
    }
```

$T(u1,u2,s1,s2) = u1+ (u2u1)+C1 = u1 + u1u2+C1 \implies O(u1u2) $ 

### 2

In this problem as in the previous ones, I will first analyze the complexity of the methods that are called in the function in which we want to measure complexity. Once this is done it will be easier to determine its complexity. 

##### empty constructor

```java
    LinkedYarn () {
        head = null;
        size = 0;
        uniqueSize = 0;
        modCount = 0;
    }
```

Clearly $O(1)$ 

##### creating an iterator

```java
Iterator (LinkedYarn y) {
    owner = y;
    itModCount = y.modCount;
    current = y.head;
    onCount = 0;
}
```

Clearly $O(1)$

##### getIterator

```java
 public LinkedYarn.Iterator getIterator () {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException();
        }
        return new LinkedYarn.Iterator(this);
    }
```

Clearly $O(1)$ 

##### hasNext (iterator)

```java
public boolean hasNext () {
    if (current.count > onCount+1) {return true;}
    return isValid() && current.next != null;
}
```

Clearly $O(1)$ 

##### veryfyIntegrity()

```java
private void verifyIntegrity () {
    if (!isValid()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException();
    }
}
```

##### Clearly $O(1)$ 

##### next (iterator)

```java
public void next () {
    verifyIntegrity(); //constant from above
    onCount++;
    if (onCount >= current.count) { 
        if (!hasNext()) {     
            throw new NoSuchElementException();
        }
        current = current.next;
        onCount = 0;
    }
}
```

Clearly $O(1)$ 

##### isValid

```java
public boolean isValid () {
    return owner.modCount == itModCount;
}
```

Clearly $O(1)$ 

##### getString

```java
public String getString () {
    verifyIntegrity(); //constant
    return current.text;
}
```

Clearly $O(1)$ 

##### remove occurrances

```java
private int removeOccurrences (String text, int count) {
    Node found = find(text); //u2 (the unique size) from problem 2
    
    // Case: no such string toRemove
    if (found == null) {
        return 0;
    }
   
    int newCount = found.count - count;
    modCount++;
        
    // Case: last instance to remove
    if (newCount <= 0) {
        deleteNode(found);
        size -= found.count;
        uniqueSize--;
        return 0;
    
    // Case: more than 1 entry left
    } else {
        found.count = newCount;
        size -= count;
        return newCount;
    }
```

In either case of this function (either of the if or else statements) all are constant so then $O(u2)$ is the complexity because of the find method.

##### remove

```java
    public int remove (String toRemove) {
        return removeOccurrences(toRemove, 1); //u2
    }
```

clearly $O(u2)$ (see explanation for insert, this one is very similar )

##### contains

```java
public boolean contains (String toCheck) {
    return find(toCheck) != null; //u2
}
```

clearly $O(u2)$ 

##### Now finally we can analize the following:

```java
  /*
   * commonThreads returns a new LinkedYarn composed of all
   * occurrences that are common between y1 and y2
   * [X] Warning: this implementation is not very good
   */
  public static LinkedYarn commonThreads (LinkedYarn y1, LinkedYarn y2) {
      LinkedYarn result = new LinkedYarn(), //C1
                 y2Clone = new LinkedYarn(y2);     //u2
      
      for (LinkedYarn.Iterator i1 = y1.getIterator(); i1.hasNext(); i1.next()) { //s1
          String current = i1.getString(); //C2
          if (y2Clone.contains(current)) { //u2
              result.insert(current);    //u1 
              y2Clone.remove(current);   //u2 (worst case y2clone is same as y1 but in mirror order)
          }
      }
      
      return result;  //C3
  }
```

$T(u1,u2,s1,s2) = C1+u2+s1(C2+u2+u1+u2) + C3$

$= C1+u2 + s1(C2 + 2u2+u1) +C3 $

$= C1+C3+ u2 + s1C2 + s1u2 + s1(u2 + u1)$ 

###### ANSWER

$\implies O(s1(u2+u1))$ 

### 3

##### count:

```java
    public int count (String toCount) {
        Node toFind = find(toCount); // u2
        return (toFind == null) ? 0 : toFind.count; //C1
    }
```

Clearly $O(u2)$

```java
  /*
   * Alternative implementation of the above that is slightly better
   */
  public static LinkedYarn betterCommonThreads (LinkedYarn y1, LinkedYarn y2) {
      LinkedYarn result = new LinkedYarn(); //C1
      for (Node curr1 = y1.head; curr1 != null; curr1 = curr1.next) { //u1
          String text = curr1.text; //C3
          int count1 = curr1.count, //C4
              count2 = y2.count(text); //u2
          if (count2 > 0) {            //C5
              result.insertOccurrences(text, Math.min(count1, count2)); //Math.min constant time. //u1
          }
      }
      
      return result; //C6
  }
```

$T(u1,u2,s1,s2) = C1 + u1(C3+C4+u2+C5+u1) + C6$

###### ANSWER

$\implies O(u1(u2+u1))$

| Homework 4: Reading Minds One Letter at a Time | 10 / 31 / 17 | 11 / 30 / 17 |

Have you ever wondered how Google just seems to read your mind when you search for only part of your query?

![img](http://forns.lmu.build/classes/assets/images/fall-2016/cmsi-281/hw/hw4-ex1.PNG)

Yes, that's right, Google was able to discern that my query was leading to "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" (for any of you Mary Poppins fans out there).

Even more interesting, is that there's something called "superchillin", which I'm too afraid to research further.

As you might imagine, Google's specific process is the combination of many complex heuristics based on your personal search history, prevailing search trends, and the linkenesses of your search compared to those that were completed successfully.

However, in this assignment, we'll be examining a powerful tree-based data structure that can be used to efficiently perform a basic version of Google's so-called **autocomplete**.

 Goal: implement a simplified version of Google's autocomplete feature using an efficient storage for known search terms.

#### Choosing a Data Structure

------

When presented with a problem like the above, your mind might race through all of the data structures you've learned hoping to find one that is objectively best for the task.

Let's review some of the putative problem requirements:

- We will be adding *many* search terms to our chosen data structure, which will consist of Strings representing search queries.
- Once we've constructed our data structure full of known search terms, we must be able to quickly look up whether any given String is contained within.
- Further, given only a portion of a String, we should be able to determine the most likely completion intended by the user.

So looking at the above, we might consider the most naive approach of storing every search term in a List and then scan through the List to find a match.

However, this is very expensive to store (doesn't take common parts of words into account), expensive to search (linear), and does not have a clear approach to suggesting autocompletions.

We might next consider binary search trees, which would allow us faster storage and search for queries if we take advantage of their alphabetical order.

However, it's still not clear how we can generate autocompletion results from a BST implementation...

Luckily, we can tweak a BST slightly to serve our purposes:

#### Ternary Search Trees

------

 **Ternary Search Trees** are trees wherein each Node has at most 3 children with application-specific semantics for left, middle, and right children.

In our autocompleter application, we want to find a parsimonious way to store words that can then be queried, and find the "closest" predicted word from only the first few letters of it.

So, we'll adopt a ternary search tree for our purpose that has the following characteristics:

- Each node will store a letter of a word in the collection.
- The "middle" reference of every node will point to the next letter in the word, in sequence (just like a linked list).
- Because some words are actually prefixes of others (e.g., "it" is a word that is a prefix of "item"), we'll mark certain nodes as "word ends" to indicate that letters collected along middle paths may legally terminate at them.
- The "left" and "right" references of every node are possibly null, but when non-null, will point to nodes in which other words are to be formed using the previous middle path that led up to them as a prefix.
- In particular, a node to the left of another will possess a letter of another word that is alphabetically less than the parent, and a node to the right of another will possess a letter of another word that is alphabetically greater than the parent.
- We then use these trees to form words by starting at the root and "collecting" letters along middle paths that match our query / insertion and then act like binary search when the letters do not match at a node (i.e., look to the left if the letter is "less than" the current, or to the right when the letter is "greater").

#### Example

------

Whew! That's a lot of words. Why don't we actually look at an example?

![img](http://forns.lmu.build/assets/images/fall-2016/cmsi-281/hw/ternary-tree-hw4.PNG)

**Example**
 Try adding another word to the above ternary tree. Where will its letters go? Which nodes will need to be marked as word ends?

**Example**
 Determine the algorithm for querying whether a word is contained within the ternary tree above. (hint: very close to binary search!)

#### Using the Ternary Tree

------

So now that you've seen the data structure, let's connect it back to our task: to create a functioning autocomplete mechanism.

The general workflow for this process will be as follows:

1. Insert search terms into the ternary tree to abide by the structure detailed above.
2. After search terms have been inserted, we may query the tree in a variety of ways:
   - Ask if the tree contains a specific search term.
   - Ask the tree to provide a suggested search term based on a given query string (which is possibly a fragment of a contained search term).
   - Ask the tree to provide a sorted list of all contained search terms.

The following specification details how we will implement the behavior above.

------

# Specifications

 **Problem 1[100 points]**

 Implement the Autocompleter class that uses a Ternary Search Tree to provide the behavior described above / below. Each method is weighted equally for determining your final score on this assignment.

#### Autocompleter

------

Your Autocompleter class will implement the following interface.

 AutocompleterInterface.java

```
  package autocompleter;
  
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  
  public interface AutocompleterInterface {
  
      boolean isEmpty();
      void addTerm(String toAdd);
      boolean hasTerm(String query);
      String getSuggestedTerm(String query);
      ArrayList<String> getSortedTerms();
  
  }
```

| Methods                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `boolean isEmpty();`Returns true if the Autocompleter has no search terms stored, false otherwise. |
| `void addTerm(String toAdd);`Adds the given search term `toAdd` to the Autocompleter by the method specified in the Ternary Tree section above.Note that for this simplified Autocompleter, the order in which terms are added to the Ternary Tree may influence the output of the `getSuggestedTerm` method detailed below. This is fine.Furthermore, the order in which terms are added can influence the efficiency of each operation if the tree becomes too linear. This, although not desirable, is fine given the time and difficulty expectations of the assignment. All inserted search terms are to be stored in their `normalized` format (see helper methods section below). |
| `boolean hasTerm(String query);`Returns true if the given `query` String exists within the Autocompleter, false otherwise. All query terms are to be referenced in their `normalized` format (see helper methods section below). |
| `String getSuggestedTerm(String query);`Returns the first* search term contained in the Autocompleter that possesses the query as a prefix (e.g., "it" is a prefix of "it" [exact match] and "item" [first two letters]).In the event that the given query is a prefix for more than one stored search term, either are acceptable return results.See the unit tests below for examples of this behavior (unit test with "goad" vs. "goat").In the event that the given query is a prefix for NO search term, return null. All query terms are to be referenced in their `normalized` format (see helper methods section below). |
| `ArrayList<String> getSortedTerms();`Returns an ArrayList of Strings consisting of the alphabetically sorted search terms within this Autocompleter.Alphabetic sorting is the same as how a dictionary sorts its entries, so for example, "ass" is considered a predecessor to "at" even though it has more letters.See the unit tests below for examples of this behavior. |

#### Provided Helper Methods

------

I have provided two helper methods to assist you in your implementation:

| Methods                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `String normalizeTerm (String s);`Throws `IllegalArgumentException();` when `s` is null or empty.Used to normalize arguments to all of the assignment methods, as well as how the terms are stored. |
| `int compareChars (char c1, char c2);`Compares two characters and returns an integer representing their alphabetical ordering. In particular:Returns some integer less than 0 whenever `c1` alphabetically preceeds `c2`.Returns 0 whenever `c1` is the same character as `c2`.Returns some integer greater than 0 whenever `c1` alphabetically follows `c2`.This method is useful for constructing and then navigating your ternary search tree. |

#### Assumptions

------

To simplify this assignment, we'll assume the following:

- You may assume there will be no punctuation, spaces, or numbers in any of the arguments to any of the above methods.
- You need make no assumptions about the order in which search terms are added to the Autocompleter so long as the above requirements are met.

------

# Unit Tests

 You may use the following sample unit tests to verify your understanding of the specifications above. Note: these are not an exclusive list of tests that I will use to grade your assignment, so to ensure as many points as possible, you should add many tests to this list (including those required above).

Unlike in HW1, you are not required to *submit* any test case modifications, but if you choose not to make any more entirely, then ask yourself: are you a gambling individual?

[ AutocompleterTests.java](http://forns.lmu.build/classes/fall-2017/cmsi-281/homework/hw4/AutocompleterTests.java)

# Solution Skeleton

 The following .zip file contains a solution skeleton that you may use for your submission's starting point. It is highly recommended that you download this as a scaffold and work from there.

[ Autocompleter Solution Skeleton](http://forns.lmu.build/classes/fall-2017/cmsi-281/homework/hw4/autocompleter.zip)

------

# Solution Restrictions

 Read the following list of submission restrictions carefully! **Violating any restriction will net you a 0 on this homework!**

- You may NOT use ANY data structure from the Java collections framework in your solution. For that matter, you may not use *any* data structure that you did not create yourself! When in doubt, ask.
- You may NOT add any methods or fields to the Autocompleter class' public interface. You may, however, add any private fields or methods that you like.
- Your classes and therefore source files must be named exactly as intimated above (as is in the Solution Skeleton), and your submission should mimic the solution skeleton's package structure.

------

# Hints

The implementation of this assignment requires you to make some design decisions. However, here are some hints for how you might structure your own.

- The above methods can be implemented iteratively or using recursion, though some methods will be vastly simplified by a clever choice of one or the other.
- Want to use recursion to implement method but also want it to have different parameters? Make a private helper method and then just call that helper from the public one!
- Although there are only a few methods for you to implement in this assignment, beware: some of the algorithms may feel non-trivial, especially if you are unused to recursion. Leave yourself ample time to test, debug, and ask questions!

# Homework 5 - Description

| Title                     | Date Posted  | Date Due     |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Homework 5: The Sentinals | 11 / 28 / 17 | 12 / 15 / 17 |

Have you ever read comments on some forum / online store and thought: "Wow, this person is really angry... why don't the moderators remove this comment?"

Conversely, you might remark, "Wow, what a kind, helpful individual; they should be rewarded for their tone!"

The problem with open forum moderation is that it is often infeasible to have a human manually examine every comment and then screen the negative ones or reward the positive.

As such, some systems employ a sentiment analyzer.

#### Sentiment Analyzers

------

 **Sentiment Analyzers** are used to take text inputs and determine if the tone or vocabulary is positive, neutral, or negative. However, because we enjoy wordplay in this class, we will refer to these as **Sentinals**.

There are various ways to implement a Sentinal:

- **Top-Down Approach:** the Sentinal designer loads a (typically large / robust) database of sentimentally charged words, classifies them as positive or negative, and then scans input text for words that match those in the database.
- **Bottom-Up Approach:** the Sentinal designer labels a wide variety of sample texts as either positive or negative, and then lets the Sentinal learn the most commonly used positive / negative phrases to then determine if future texts are positive or negative.

In this assignment, we'll be designing a Top-Down Sentinal, wherein our Sentinal users will be able to load sentiment files containing phrases that will then be matched against analyzed text.

#### Choosing a Data Structure

------

Since the sentiment files will typically be very large, and we will need to consult them frequently to see if a given phrase exists within, we will use a simple hash table or two (which we'll call PhraseHashes) to contain the various sentiment phrases.

The overall process will look like this:

1. A Sentinal is created with a given positive phrase bank and negative phrase bank.
2. With these phrases loaded into the Sentinal's PhraseHashes, a document can then have its sentiment analyzed by comparing its phrases to those found in each PhraseHash.
3. At the conclusion of our Sentinal's analyses, we will conclude that the analyzed document had a positive, neutral, or negative tone.

So, since we will frequently consult our sentiment phrase database while analyzing a document, we need a DS with lightening-fast lookup -- luckily, we just learned about hash tables!

Note that lists and BSTs are not good fits for this task, since their insertion and lookup are slower, and we need not take advantage of their element orderings.

#### Assignment Goals

------

This assignment may look ostensibly trivial, but note that it requires you to do the following:

- Be able to decompose a large problem into many smaller problems that can be solved more easily; I don't exactly suggest a recursive solution here, but the ability to make meaningful helper methods will be tested herein.
- Lookup language mechanics that might make your task easier. This might mean Googling how to do something or consulting the manuals for various Java libraries.
- Manage test files in your workspace wherein your program will be required to interact with files outside of its source.

 Note: sentiment analysis, and natural language processing in general, is an open problem in AI with many different approaches. The one we will explore herein is fairly brittle, but will give us some great practice with data structures and one of their important applications.

------

# Specifications

In this assignment, you will implement two relatively small classes:

1. `PhraseHash`: a hash table for storing sentiment phrases
2. `Sentinal`: the sentiment analyzer that uses your PhraseHashes.

#### PhraseHash

------

 **Problem 1[40 points]**

 Implement a simple **PhraseHash** table in which we will store our sentiment phrases.

 A **sentiment phrase** is a String consisting of 1 or more space-separated words, like "good" or "very good".

 Your PhraseHash, for simplicty, will follow the **separate chaining** bucket schema with 1000 LinkedList buckets.

Your PhraseHash class implements the PhraseHashInterface.java interface, whose methods are detailed below:

| Methods                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `boolean isEmpty ();`Returns true if the PhraseHash has no phrases stored, false otherwise. |
| `int size ();`Returns the number of phrases currently stored in the PhraseHash. |
| `void put (String s);`Inserts the given phrase `s` into the PhraseHash, with duplicates ignored (i.e., do not insert a second copy of s into the PhraseHash if it is already contained within).Note: your put and get methods will require that you define a hash function that maps Strings to your bucket indexes. You should attempt to craft a function that exibits the desirable hash function traits we mentioned in class (see Lecture 14T). Lazy hash functions that will have needless collisions will be penalized. |
| `String get (String s);`Returns the given phrase `s` if it exists in the PhraseHash, `null` otherwise. |
| `int longestLength ();`Returns the length of the longest phrase in the PhraseHash, or 0 if it is empty.A phrase like "good" has a length of 1, a phrase like "very good" has a length of 2. |

#### Sentinal

------

 **Problem 2[60 points]**

 Implement a simple **Sentinal (Sentiment Analyzer)** that stores sentiment phrases in PhraseHash fields and compares the text of target documents to the words in these PhraseHashes (with the goal of determining the tone of the target document).

 A Sentinal loads its sentiment phrases from **sentiment files**, which contain **new-line separated** phrases that are each meant to be added to the Sentinal's PhraseHashes.

Your Sentinal class will implement the SentinalInterface.java interface, whose methods are detailed below (the order in which the methods are listed are my suggested order of completion):

| Methods                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `void loadSentiment (String phrase, boolean positive);`Loads a single `phrase` into the Sentinal.Stores the phrase in the positive-phrase hash if parameter positive is true, or the negative-phrase hash if the parameter positive is false. |
| `void loadSentimentFile (String filename, boolean positive) throws FileNotFoundException;`Loads all newline-separated phrases from the given sentiment file into the Sentinal's appropriate PhraseHash.Stores the phrases in the positive-phrase hash if parameter positive is true, or the negative-phrase hash if the parameter positive is false. |
| `Sentinal(String posFile, String negFile);`The only constructor for a Sentinal object that takes as input a positive-sentiment phrase file path, as well as a negative-sentiment phrase file.The constructor will then load each sentiment file into its appropriate posHash and negHash PhraseHashes. |
| `String sentinalyze (String filename) throws FileNotFoundException;`The main workhorse method of each Sentinal object, which takes the name of a file to analyze.The file will contain 1 or more **newline separated** sentences whose words must be scanned for sentiment.For each sentence in the file, the Sentinal will scan it to find phrase matches in both its positive-PhraseHash and negative-PhraseHash.It will then output a String based on the following criteria:"positive": if the file contained more positive phrases than negative."neutral": if the file contained an equal number of positive and negative phrases (including 0 of each)."negative": if the file contained more negative phrases than positive. |

 You must look up how to parse text from a .txt file in Java using the Scanner (which we covered at the beginning of the semester) and the File classes. This will be useful in your constructor, loadSentimentFile, and sentinalyze methods.

  bad
  awful
  terrible
  horrific
  negative
  sad
  poorly
  negligent
  not good
  sloppy job
```

**Example 1:**

 comDoc.txt

```
  this assignment is awesome
  if only this sentence was not bad
  oh well i guess it is still positive
```

A Sentinal with the given posPhrases and negPhrases would classify the comDoc (with 3 sentences) as having a "positive" tone, decomposed as follows:

1. The first sentence contains 1 positive phrase, "awesome" [+1]
2. The second sentence contains 1 negative phrase, "bad" [-1]
3. The third sentence contains 1 positive phrase, "positive" [+1]

In total, there are 2 positive sentiments and 1 negative, therefore the document is considered "positive".

**Example 2:**

 comDoc2.txt

```
  andrew is not good
  he is excellent
  his sloppy job is actually a great job
```

Notice that our Sentinals are actually pretty brittle because they fail to pick up on some nuances of language.

In the above, the writer used dramatic impact by first saying "andrew is not good" as a setup to the next sentence: "he is excellent".

However, since we have a naive scoring system, the "not good" from the first sentence cancels the "excellent" from the second.

A Sentinal with the given posPhrases and negPhrases would classify the comDoc2 (with 3 sentences) as having a "neutral" tone, decomposed as follows:

1. The first sentence contains 1 negative phrase, "not good" [-1]
2. The second sentence contains 1 positive phrase, "excellent" [+1]
3. The third sentence contains 1 negative phrase, "sloppy job" [-1] and 1 positive phrase, "great job" [+1]

In total, there are 2 positive sentiments and 2 negative, therefore the document is considered "neutral".

**Example 3:**

 comDoc3.txt

```
  my code is sloppy
  i hope andrew grades kindly
  i will be quite sad
```

I know what you're thinking, and yes, that's a haiku.

A Sentinal with the given posPhrases and negPhrases would classify the comDoc3 (with 3 sentences) as having a "negative" tone, decomposed as follows:

1. The first sentence contains 0 sentimental phrases (even though sloppy is a word within "sloppy job"), [0]
2. The second sentence contains 0 sentimental phrases, [0]
3. The third sentence contains 1 negative phrase, "sad" [-1]

In total, there is 1 negative phrase, therefore the document is considered "negative".

#### Assumptions

------

To simplify this assignment, we'll assume the following:

- You may assume there will be no punctuation, spaces, capital letters, or numbers in any of the arguments to any of the above methods, nor in any input files.
- You need make no assumptions about the order in which phrases are added to each PhraseHash so long as the above requirements are met.
- You may assume that, for entered phrases into a PhraseHash, no phrase of size m is a subset of a phrase of size k for m <= k. In other words, you would not find both "great" and "great job" in a positive word dictionary, because "great" is a subset of "great job".
- You may assume that sentences do not continue onto new lines when reading from a file in `sentinalyze`. In other words, consider only phrases of length greater than one that are on the same line.
- You may assume that all given filenames represent **absolute paths** to the files on your file system. An absolute path is one that is specified from your root drive to the specific file such as "S:/Users/aforn/workspace/cmsi-281/src/sentinal/". See SentinalTests.java for more info.
- All methods that parse files will `throws FileNotFoundException` when the provided file is not found on the system or at the path specified. You will not need to throw this exception manually since you will use the Scanner class to parse your files.
- Due to time constraints, you are not expected to do anything fancy for your phrase matching during sentinalysis, but at least challenge yourself to not scan for phrases of length 4 if, say, the largest phrase in the sentiment-specific PhraseHash that you are parsing has a longestLength of 3 (or 2 or 1).

# Unit Tests

 You may use the following sample unit tests to verify your understanding of the specifications above. Note: these are not an exclusive list of tests that I will use to grade your assignment, so to ensure as many points as possible, you should add many tests to this list (including those required above).

Unlike in HW1, you are not required to *submit* any test case modifications, but if you choose not to make any more entirely, then ask yourself: do you have any other masochistic tendencies?

 Please download the PhraseHashTests.java and SentinalTests.java from the solution skeleton below.

# Solution Skeleton

 The following .zip file contains a solution skeleton that you may use for your submission's starting point. It is highly recommended that you download this as a scaffold and work from there.

# Solution Restrictions

 Read the following list of submission restrictions carefully! **Violating any restriction will net you a 0 on this homework!**

- You may ONLY use the LinkedList data structure from the Java collections framework in your solution. You may not use *any* other data structure that you did not create yourself! When in doubt, ask.
- You MAY use some convenient methods from other Java classes, like the String and Arrays classes.
- You may NOT add any methods or fields to your class' public interface. You may, however, add any private fields or methods that you like.
- Your classes and therefore source files must be named exactly as intimated above (as is in the Solution Skeleton), and your submission should mimic the solution skeleton's package structure.

# Hints

The implementation of this assignment requires you to make some design decisions. However, here are some hints for how you might structure your own.

- In analyzing files with your Sentinals, I suggest breaking down its "positive / negative phrase count" into several hierarchical steps: parse sentence by sentence in the file (i.e., line by line), then within each sentence, count each pos / neg phrase of length 1, then 2, etc. until you have a sum of the number of phrases found.
- If one step of the above feels difficult, break it down! Make a helper method that will allow you to decompose the total file scoring into smaller bits.
