/**
*Design a class called ForneymonCard that adheres to the following specifications.
*Every ForneymonCard has a name and a type of Forneymon (one of three options:
*"Burnymon", "Dampymon", "Leafymon").
*When creating a new ForneymonCard object, we will populate the fields with its
*given name and its type of Forneymon.
*If the card was constructed with a blank name, throw new IllegalArgumentException();
*If the card was constructed with a type that is anything other than the three
*allowed, throw new IllegalArgumentException();
*ForneymonCards can *also* be default constructed (no arguments given), at which
*point its name should be "MissingNu" and its type "Burnymon".
*When printed out (i.e., for toString()), a ForneymonCard shall return a String
*of the format: "Type: NameOfForneymon". E.g., a Burnymon named Burny would return: "Burnymon: Burny"
