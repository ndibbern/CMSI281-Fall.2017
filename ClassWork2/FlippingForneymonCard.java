/**
 * Design a class called FlippingForneymonCard that adheres to the following specifications.
 *
 * FlippingForneymonCards are ForneymonCards (share properties and methods)
 except that they may be placed face-up or face-down. You shall implement this
  property as a boolean field that is false when face-up and true when face-down.
 * FlippingForneymonCards can be constructed as either face-up or face-down as
 long as a name and type of Forneymon are specified.
 * FlippingForneymonCards can be default constructed (no arguments given), at
 *which point its name should be "MissingNu", its type "Burnymon", and face-down.
 * Each FlippingForneymonCard can flip(); which makes it face-up if it was
 *previously face-down, and vice versa. Return true if the card is face-down, and false otherwise.
 * Define a method int match (FlippingForneymonCard other); that returns:
 * 2 if either it or the other FlippingForneymonCard are face-down.
 * 1 if both are face-up and share the same name *and* Forneymon type.
 * 0 if both are face-up and disagree on either the name *or* the Forneymon type.
 * A FlippingForneymonCard that is currently face-down will instead return the
 *string "?: ?" when toString() is called on it.
 * A FlippingForneymonCard that is currently face-up will use the default
 *toString() behavior.
