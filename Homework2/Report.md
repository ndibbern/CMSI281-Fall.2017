# HW2 Report:

In my opinion programming both the sequential list and the linked list felt really similar. Sequential list was more intuitive since I am more used to working with arrays than I do with references. Furthermore, eventhough we went through the iterator class in class, it was not as intuitive how to do all the methods such that they would work with the LinkedYarn.

On the other hand, I feel like some operatations' logic (such as add, remove all, remove) where harder to do on the Yarn class given that we had no prior experience of how a Yarn worked. When I got to implement the LinkedYarn, I already had an intuition of the steps that such methods needed to follow in order to work correctly, the only thing that changed was doing it in a Linked List rather than an array, but the algorithm was the same. Because of this, I believe the level of "difficulty" between both balanced out such that both were at the same level.

I wold rather use a linked list implementation on a scenario where I have to do a lot of insertion..
